# The g factor (General Intelligence)

**Associated Branch:** Psychometrics

The **g factor**, or general intelligence factor, is a construct developed in psychometric investigations of cognitive abilities and human intelligence. It is a variable that summarizes positive correlations among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks.

## Overview and History

The concept of the `g` factor was first proposed by the English psychologist **Charles Spearman** in 1904. Spearman observed that children's performance across seemingly unrelated school subjects was positively correlated. This led him to hypothesize that a single underlying mental ability influences performance on all cognitive tests.

### Spearman's Two-Factor Theory
Spearman's theory posits that all variation in performance on intelligence tests can be attributed to two components:
1.  **The g factor:** A general mental energy or capacity that contributes to performance on every cognitive task.
2.  **s factors:** Specific abilities unique to individual mental tasks (e.g., spatial reasoning, musical memory, or verbal fluency).

## Key Characteristics

*   **Positive Manifold:** The existence of `g` is supported by the "positive manifold"—the universal finding that all cognitive abilities correlate positively with one another.
*   **Latent Variable (The "Virtual" Factor):** In psychometrics, `g` is a **latent variable**. This means it is not directly observable but is inferred from the correlations between different tests. We cannot measure `g` directly; we can only estimate an individual's "expected value" for it by observing their performance on a wide battery of cognitive tasks (IQ tests).
*   **Statistical Construct:** It is typically identified through **factor analysis**. The first unrotated principal component usually accounts for 40-50% of the total variance in a battery of cognitive tests.

## The Nature of g: Abstract vs. Concrete

A central debate in psychology is whether `g` represents a single "concrete" biological property or is merely a "virtual" statistical abstraction:

1.  **Biological Realism:** This view suggests `g` corresponds to a physical property of the brain, such as neural efficiency, brain volume, or the integrity of white matter tracts.
2.  **Sampling Theory:** Proposed by Godfrey Thomson, this view suggests that `g` is an emergent property. Because any complex task requires a large "sample" of independent mental processes, the overlapping use of these processes across different tasks creates the statistical *illusion* of a single underlying factor.

## Predictive Validity
The `g` factor is one of the most reliable predictors of academic achievement, job performance, and various life outcomes.

While the `g` factor remains a central concept in psychometrics, modern theories often place it within a hierarchical structure, such as the **Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory**. In this model, `g` sits at the top (Stratum III), with broad abilities like fluid intelligence ($G_f$) and crystallized intelligence ($G_c$) at Stratum II.
