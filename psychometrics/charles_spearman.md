# Charles Spearman

**Associated Branch:** Psychometrics (and Cognitive Psychology)

Charles Spearman (1863-1945) was an English psychologist known for his pioneering work in statistics, as a pioneer of psychometrics, and for his development of the two-factor theory of intelligence. His contributions profoundly influenced the study and measurement of human intelligence.

## Key Contributions:

*   **Two-Factor Theory of Intelligence:** Proposed that intelligence consists of two factors: a [general intelligence factor (`g`)](./g_factor.md), which underlies various cognitive abilities, and specific factors (`s`), which are unique to particular tasks. The `g` factor suggested a common, underlying mental capacity.
*   **Factor Analysis:** Developed factor analysis, a statistical method used to identify underlying variables or factors that explain the correlations among a set of observed variables. This method became a cornerstone of psychometrics and is widely used in various scientific fields.
*   **Coefficient of Correlation:** While not inventing it, Spearman refined and popularized the use of the correlation coefficient, particularly his rank correlation coefficient.
*   **Foundations of Psychometrics:** His work laid much of the groundwork for the scientific measurement of psychological constructs, especially intelligence.
