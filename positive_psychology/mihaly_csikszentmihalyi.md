**Associated Branch:** Positive Psychology

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1934-2021) was a Hungarian-American psychologist who is most widely known for his groundbreaking work on happiness and creativity, and particularly for developing the concept of "Flow." He was a prominent figure in the field of positive psychology, which focuses on human strengths and optimal functioning rather than pathology.

## Key Contributions:

*   **Flow Theory:** Introduced the psychological concept of "Flow," a mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. This state is characterized by complete absorption in what one does.
*   **Optimal Experience:** His research explored the conditions under which people experience deep engagement, creativity, and enjoyment, leading to a deeper understanding of human flourishing.
*   **Positive Psychology:** As a co-founder and leading researcher in positive psychology, he contributed significantly to shifting the focus of psychology from repairing the worst things in life to building positive qualities.
*   **Creativity Research:** Investigated the nature of creativity, viewing it not just as an individual trait but as a systemic process involving interaction between individuals, domains, and fields.
