# John Bowlby

**Associated Branch:** Developmental Psychology

John Bowlby (1907-1990) was a British psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and psychologist, best known for his pioneering work in attachment theory. His research focused on the importance of early relationships, particularly between children and their primary caregivers, and their profound impact on later emotional and social development.

## Key Contributions:

*   **Attachment Theory:** Developed the influential theory of attachment, positing that humans have an innate psychobiological system (the attachment behavioral system) that motivates them to seek proximity to significant others (attachment figures) in times of need or threat.
*   **Maternal Deprivation Hypothesis:** Initially proposed that prolonged deprivation of maternal care in early childhood could lead to severe long-term negative consequences, including intellectual, social, and emotional maladjustment.
*   **Internal Working Models:** Suggested that early attachment experiences lead to the formation of "internal working models" – cognitive representations of self, others, and relationships – that guide future social interactions.
*   **Ethological Perspective:** Integrated concepts from ethology (the study of animal behavior) into psychology, emphasizing the evolutionary basis of attachment behaviors for survival.
